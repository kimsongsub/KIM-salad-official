          15% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from livestock raising.
          Greenhouse gas isn't the only environmental problem associated with
          cattle.<br /><br />
          The dung produced by cows is equivalent to the share of 16 people. As

            According to the Israel Institute, only 4% of all mammals on Earth
            are wild. That means that 96% of the world is covered by humans and
            livestock for human consumption.<br /><br />

            The number of animals slaughtered per year, however, is much higher.
            A cow's lifespan is 18 months, which is one of the longest, but a
            pig's is only 6 months.Unfortunately, chickens are brought to the
            slaughterhouse the fastest as a result of growth-promoting
            breeding.<br /><br />
            In Korea, it is shipped within 31 days of hatching and is fast
            enough to be listed in the Guinness Book of Records.
