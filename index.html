              15% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from livestock
              raising. Greenhouse gas isn't the only environmental problem
              associated with cattle. The dung produced by cows is equivalent to
              the share of 16 people. As a result, there are problems with water
              quality and soil contamination.

              <p id="content3-2-1">
                According to the Israel Institute, only 4% of all mammals on
                Earth are wild. That means that 96% of the world is covered by
                humans and livestock for human consumption.<br /><br />

                The number of animals slaughtered per year, however, is much
                higher. A cow's lifespan is 18 months, which is one of the
                longest, but a pig's is only 6 months.Unfortunately, chickens
                are brought to the slaughterhouse the fastest as a result of
                growth-promoting breeding.<br /><br />
                In Korea, it is shipped within 31 days of hatching and is fast
                enough to be listed in the Guinness Book of Records.
